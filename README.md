# Bank_Failures
Commercial Banking Failures 1934-Present

We will be using this dataset found on Kaggle as the basis for some predictive models.  We will be taking a look at addtional data on banks that did not fail, to see if we can develop a model that can us if a bank failed or not, using easy to find values from bank balance sheets.  As a risk manager I would love to see these models do well, so that I could build my own risk management scorecard for likely to fail thresholds.
